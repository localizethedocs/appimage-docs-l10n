Contact
=======

The AppImage project documentation is brought to you by `the AppImage team <https://github.com/AppImage>`__. The source code is available `on GitHub <https://github.com/AppImage/docs.appimage.org>`__.

This page outlines how you can contact the team behind AppImage, e.g., to get additional support or have questions answered.


IRC
---

If you have further questions, please feel free to contact the AppImage team. The easiest and fastest way is to join our `IRC channel #appimage <ircs://irc.libera.chat/appimage>`__ on `Libera.Chat <https://libera.chat>`__ (`webchat <https://web.libera.chat/#AppImage>`__).

You can join the channel from Matrix, too: ``#appimage:libera.chat``.

.. note::

   Please beware that it might take a few minutes/hours until someone will check the chat and might be able to help you, so don't give up too quickly, and leave e.g., the tab open in the background if you can. You can also try at other times again. Please read `this article <https://workaround.org/getting-help-on-irc/>`__ before joining the IRC chat if you are new to IRC.

.. seealso::

   The :code:`#appimage` channel on freenode has been abandoned and is not maintained by the AppImage project. The channel :code:`##appimage` (which was created after :code:`#appimage` was forcefully removed because it mentioned our move) has never been official and has never been maintained by us.

   Please see `this article <https://www.devever.net/~hl/freenode_abuse2>`__ for more information on what happened to our channel and why we planned to transition to a new network.


Forum
-----

A slower but more sustainable way is to use the `Discourse forum <https://discourse.appimage.org>`__. You can log in using your existing Google or GitHub account, or alternatively register a local account with your email address.
