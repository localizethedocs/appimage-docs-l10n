"What happens when an AppImage is run is that the operating system runs the "
"AppImage as an executable. The runtime, the executable part, tries to mount "
"the file system image using :ref:`FUSE <ref-fuse>`. If that succeeds, the :"
"ref:`AppDir <ref-appdir>` is available in a :ref:`temporary mountpoint <ref-"
"temporary-mountpoint>`, and can be used like a read-only directory."
msgstr ""
"當 AppImage 被執行時，作業系統會把它當作可執行檔來執行。執行階段（可執行部"
"分）會使用 :ref:`FUSE <ref-fuse>` 掛載檔案系統映像。若成功，:ref:`AppDir "
"<ref-appdir>` 會出現在 :ref:`暫時掛載點 <ref-temporary-mountpoint>`，並可像唯"
"讀目錄一樣使用。"

msgid ""
"The runtime continues by calling the AppDir's \"entrypoint\" :ref:`AppRun "
"<ref-apprun>` using the operating system facilities. There are no checks "
"performed by the runtime, the operating system is simply tasked with the "
"execution of ``<AppDir mountpoint>/AppRun``. This provides a lot of "
"flexibility, as AppRun can be an arbitrary executable, a script with a "
"shebang_, or even a simple symlink to another executable within the AppDir. "
"The file must be executable."
msgstr ""
"接著執行階段會透過作業系統的機制呼叫 AppDir 的「入口點」:ref:`AppRun <ref-"
"apprun>`。執行階段不會做任何檢查，作業系統僅負責執行 ``<AppDir 掛載點>/"
"AppRun``。這帶來高度彈性，因為 AppRun 可以是任意可執行檔、含有 shebang_ 的腳"
"本，甚至只是指向 AppDir 內另一個可執行檔的符號連結。該檔案必須可執行。"
