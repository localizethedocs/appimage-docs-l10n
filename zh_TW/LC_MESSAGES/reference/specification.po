"The documentation receives updates regularly, e.g., to fix bugs or document "
"new features. For type 2, a decision was made to not release specific "
"versions but work with continuous releases. This implies there might be some "
"AppImages that lack newer features because they're using an older runtime, "
"etc. Backwards compatibility is maintained by the team in the reference "
"implementation."
