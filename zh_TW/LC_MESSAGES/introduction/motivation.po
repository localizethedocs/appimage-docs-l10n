"All these use cases can be accomplished by using AppImages. They're a trade-"

"bundling software."

"以上情境都能透過 AppImage 達成。它是在簡單使用體驗與檔案大小之間的取捨。其獨"

"As AppImage has been around for a while, a lot of useful, optional features "
"have been developed, ranging from :ref:`efficient updates <ref-"

"An important advantage is that AppImage is designed from ground to run "
"without super user permissions. Almost all major distributions are "
"compatible with AppImages, without requiring the user to make modifications "
"to the base system. AppImages ship with their own runtime, and don't require "
"external resources if packaged properly. Students in university labs for "
"instance can simply put an AppImage on a USB disk and use it normally, on "
"any machine."
msgstr ""
"一項重要優勢是 AppImage 從一開始就設計為不需超級使用者權限即可執行。幾乎所有"
"主流散布版都相容 AppImage，且不需使用者修改基礎系統。AppImage 內建自己的執行"
"階段，若打包得當就不需外部資源。例如在大學實驗室中，學生可將 AppImage 放在 "
"USB 隨身碟上，於任何電腦上正常使用。"

"Many developers have found that they can deploy their apps to most operating "
"systems with viable efforts. They can say, \"I make binaries for Windows\", "
"or \"I make binaries for macOS\". However, when trying to do the same for "
"Linux, they commonly face a situation where they cannot \"make binaries for "
"Linux\", but they have to make them for Ubuntu, Debian, CentOS, openSUSE "
"etc. Read: they have to make binaries for every distribution."

"許多開發者發現，他們能以可行的成本將應用程式部署到多數作業系統。他們可以說"
"「我為 Windows 製作二進位檔」或「我為 macOS 製作二進位檔」。然而，對 Linux 來"
"說，他們經常面臨無法「為 Linux 製作二進位檔」，而是必須為 Ubuntu、Debian、"
"CentOS、openSUSE 等各別製作。也就是說，必須為每個散布版製作二進位檔。"

"The problem with this is that Linux is just the kernel, but the operating "
"systems users run are separate projects with separate goals and concerns. "
"They all ship with different versions and combinations of certain libraries, "
"and most of them require software to be shipped separately, linking to "
"binaries in the distribution. Therefore, in order to be able to run a "
"certain binary, that binary must be compiled *against* the distribution's "
"set of libraries. As soon as another distribution's collection of libraries "
"is not the same as the one the binary was built on, it will crash or even "
"refuse to run."
msgstr ""
"問題在於 Linux 只是核心，而使用者實際使用的作業系統是彼此獨立的專案，有各自的"
"目標與考量。它們提供的函式庫版本與組合各不相同，且大多要求軟體以散布版的二進"
"位檔為依據進行連結與散布。因此，某個二進位檔要能執行，必須針對該散布版的函式"
"庫集合 *編譯*。一旦換到另一個散布版，其函式庫集合不同，就可能崩潰或拒絕執行。"

"To fix this issue, one has to do the same one would do to prevent issues "

"為解決此問題，必須像在其他平台上避免缺少共享函式庫（或版本不相容）一樣，將相"

"This can be accomplished using traditional tarballs that contain all the "
"libraries and maybe some sort of \"run script\" that makes sure only those "
"libraries are run, but it has a few major disadvantages. First of all, it is "
"hard to get the right set of libraries that must be shipped, excluding the "
"ones that would cause issues (lowest level dependencies such as ``libc``, "
"``libdl``, etc.). But even worse, the user is presented with an archive that "
"they must extract, and they must be explained how to actually run the "
"software within it. Furthermore, they now have that data on their hard "
"drive, and have to manage it themselves, without any kind of helpers."
msgstr ""
"這可透過傳統的 tarball 來達成，裡面包含所有函式庫，並可能附帶某種「執行腳本」"
"以確保只使用這些函式庫。但這樣有幾個重大缺點。首先，要找出必須打包的正確函式"

"易。更糟的是，使用者面對的是必須解壓的壓縮檔，還需要教他們如何執行其中的軟"

"In order to improve the usability and reduce the maintenance effort, "
"AppImage was created. AppImages are bundles of programs, their dependency "

"Making AppImages is very simple for a developer. There's tools which "

"aware of potential cross distro incompatibilities, and try to avoid them. "
"And once the AppImage has been built, it will \"just run\" on all major "
"desktop distributions."
