"binaries for Linux users just the same way they could do for other operating "
"systems. It allow packaging applications for any common Linux based "
"operating system, e.g., Ubuntu, Debian, openSUSE, RHEL, CentOS, Fedora etc. "
"AppImages come with all dependencies that cannot be assumed to be part of "
"each target system in a recent enough version and will run on most Linux "
"distributions without further modifications."
