"Traditionally, applications have been installed on Linux systems by using "

"model does not scale well for long-tail applications, applications that are "
"only used by a few users, or in cases where users want to use the very "
"latest applications immediately after they are published by their "
"developers. It also is very cumbersome for application developers that want "
"to reach a large audience quickly."

"On the desktop, users are used to installing an operating system, using that "
"operating systems for many years, and running the most recent applications "
"whenever they feel like it. However, many Linux distributions restrict the "
"availability of applications to those that were already published at the "
"point in time when the Linux distribution was published. This effectively "
"means that if the user wants to use a stable operating system, then the user "
"is locked into a set of applications that was recent at the point when the "
"operating system was released. While this may be reasonable for enterprise-"
"critical applications or server side processes, it is not the model users "
"expect from a desktop operating system."

"So-called \"rolling release\" distributions exist that provide latest "
"versions of software. However, they make no distinction between the core "
"operating system and applications. So, with a \"rolling release\" "
"distribution users don’t only get the latest applications, but also an ever-"
"changing base system. While this may be suitable for hobbyists and "
"technology enthusiasts, it is hardly suitable for productive use where the "
"base system has to be supportable."

"The combination of a long-term stable base operating system with the latest "

"AppImage also makes it easy to try out new versions of applications. Since "
"versions can exist alongside each other, the user can simply download a new "
"version of an application and try it out. If the new version proves to be "
"superior, the user can then delete the old version and work with the new "
"one. However, should the new version have bugs or be otherwise unusable, the "
"user can simply delete the new version and continue using the old version. "

"Application authors may want to reach as many users as possible, regardless "
"of the operating system and version users are running.  With the traditional "
"model, application authors either need to get their application into Linux "
"distributions by creating packages according to the rules of distributions, "
"which can be a lengthy and time-consuming process, or need to find someone "
"who creates the application package for them. It does not help that "
"different Linux distributions have very different rules for packaging "
"applications. This means that if an author is successful to package an "
"application according to the rules of one distribution, it may well not be "
"suitable for inclusion in another distribution. In any case, it is not a "
"quick and easy operation to get a new application into every Linux "
"distribution. And even if an author gets an application into a Linux "
"distribution, it will only appear in the soon-to-be-released version of that "
"Linux distribution, which means that all the currently existing users using "
"older versions of the Linux distribution are left out in the cold."

"異極大。作者即使依某個散布版規則成功打包，也可能不適用於另一個散布版。總之，"
"讓新應用程式進入每個 Linux 散布版既不快速也不容易。即便應用程式成功進入某個 "

"If a third party (the distribution's \"maintainer\") packages the "

"Some developers do not want their applications to be distributed randomly, "

"other cases still, the application author may want to ask for a donation or "
"even a required payment before the user can download the application through "
