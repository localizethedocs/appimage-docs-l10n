"So you decided to make an AppImage or two? Great! Or did you just come here "
"to get some insights into how AppImages can be built? Let's have a look."

"There are many different approaches how to build AppImages. Often, packaging "
"an AppImage correctly depends on the application that you're trying to put "
"into one, the so-called *payload*. Different programming languages (or, "
"rather, different application types (i.e., native binaries, scripts, "
"bytecode, etc.)) require different methods."

"All application bundling attempts have one thing in common: the \"input "
"format\" which is then turned into an AppImage using :ref:`appimagetool <ref-"
"appimagetool>`. This input format is called AppDir, and is described in the :"
"ref:`AppDir specification <ref-appdir-specification>`."

"In a nutshell: packaging AppImages is building an AppDir. This AppDir is "
"then simply turned into an AppImage. But if your AppDir is not built "
"correctly, the AppImage won't work."

"Of course, you're not left alone with this challenge. There are official as "
"well as unofficial tools that allow you to create working AppDirs. These are "
"described in the following sections. Just pick the one you think suits your "
"needs, and start making AppImages."
