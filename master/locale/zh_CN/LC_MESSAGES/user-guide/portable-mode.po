"This page describes a mode some newer AppImages (i.e., built in 2017 or "
"later) provide, the *portable mode*. This mode allows for bundling an "
"application's data next to the application's AppImage."

"Sometimes it can be useful for data of an application to travel along with "
"the application, for example to put the application on a USB stick that can "
"be used with different computers. In the windows world, this concept is "
"known as “portable applications”."

"Normally the application contained inside an AppImage will store its "
"configuration files wherever it always stores them (most frequently "
"somewhere inside :code:`$HOME`). In other words, the fact that an "
"application is contained inside an AppImage normally does not change where "
"the application stores its data."

"However, there is functionality in newer AppImages that can make the "
"application's data travel along with the application, if certain directories "
"are present *next to the AppImage file*."

"If you invoke an AppImage built with a recent version of AppImageKit and "
"have one of these special directories in place, then the configuration files "
"will be stored alongside the AppImage. This can be useful for portable use "
"cases, e.g., carrying an AppImage on a USB stick, along with its data."
