"An AppImage is a downloadable file for Linux that contains an application "

"translations, etc.) that cannot be reasonably expected to be part of each "
"target system."

"Using the optional appimaged daemon, you can easily integrate AppImages with "
"the system. The daemon puts AppImages into the menus, registers MIME types, "
"icons, all on the fly. You can download it from this repository. But it is "
"entirely optional."

"An important point about the AppImage format is that you can store AppImage "
"files wherever you want. This includes your home directory, your downloads "
"directory, a dedicated applications directory, a USB thumb drive, a CD-ROM "
"or DVD, or even a network file share. No matter where you keep your "
"AppImages, you are still able to run them. This is very similar to how "
"applications work on macOS. Unlike with traditional Linux packages, you do "
"not need to install AppImages or put them into some special location in "
"order for them to work."

"If you don't want to leave them in :code:`$HOME/Downloads`, then :code:"
"`$HOME/Applications` is a good choice. Many third-party tools (especially "
"the ones managing desktop integration) use this location, too. Other options "
"involve :code:`$HOME/.local/bin` and :code:`$HOME/bin`, which are useful "
"mainly for CLI tools."

"Besides, every other location works, e.g., a USB thumbdrive, a network "
"location, or a CD-ROM, but then the AppImages won't be on your path, which "

"the full path."
