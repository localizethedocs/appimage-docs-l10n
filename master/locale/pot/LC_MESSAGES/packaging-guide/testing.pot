"Testing your AppImage is a very important step in producing an AppImage. "
"Since AppImage files are supposed to run on a variety of Linux "
"distributions, it is important to test your AppImage on a wide variety of "
"distributions."

"This is an important step which you should not skip. Subtle differences in "
"distributions make this a must. While it is possible in most cases to create "
"AppImages that run on various distributions, this does not come "
"automatically, but requires careful hand-tuning."

"To ensure that the AppImage runs on the intended base systems, it should be "
"thoroughly tested on each of them. The following testing procedure is both "
"efficient and effective: Get the previous version of Ubuntu, Fedora, and "
"openSUSE Live CDs and test your AppImage there. Using the three largest "
"distributions increases the chances that your AppImage will run on other "
"distributions as well. Using the previous (current minus one) version "
"ensures that your end users who might not have upgraded to the latest "
"version yet can still run your AppImage."

"Using Live CDs has the advantage that unlike installed systems, you always "
"have a system that is in a factory-fresh condition that can be easily "
"reproduced. Most developers just test their software on their main working "
"systems, which tend to be heavily customized through the installation of "
"additional packages. By testing on Live CDs, you can be sure that end users "
"will get the best experience possible."

"You can use ISOs of Live CDs, loop-mount them, chroot into them, and run the "
"AppImage there. This way, you need approximately 700 MB per supported base "
"system (distribution) and can easily upgrade to newer versions by just "
"exchanging one ISO file. The following script automates this for Ubuntu-like "
"(Casper-based) and Fedora-like (Dract-based) Live ISOs:"

"In addition to Live CD ISOs, it is possible to use Docker containers to test "
"an AppImage package on a large variety of Linux distributions. This approach "

"corresponding DockerFile that allows to build a container with a minimal set "
"of dependencies needed to run an AppImage package."
