"All these use cases can be accomplished by using AppImages. They're a trade-"
"off between a simple user experience and resulting file size. The unique "
"user experience guarantees that even less tech-savvy people can get started "
"without any major issues. AppImage is primarily a user-focused way of "
"bundling software."

"As AppImage has been around for a while, a lot of useful, optional features "
"have been developed, ranging from :ref:`efficient updates <ref-"
"appimageupdate>` over so-called :ref:`desktop integration <ref-desktop-"
"integration>` to :ref:`software catalogs <ref-appimagehub>`. None of these "
"are required for the basic experience, though. AppImages are designed to :"
"ref:`be run in three steps at most <ref-download-make-executable-run>`."

"An important advantage is that AppImage is designed from ground to run "
"without super user permissions. Almost all major distributions are "
"compatible with AppImages, without requiring the user to make modifications "
"to the base system. AppImages ship with their own runtime, and don't require "
"external resources if packaged properly. Students in university labs for "
"instance can simply put an AppImage on a USB disk and use it normally, on "
"any machine."

"To sum up: AppImages provide a easy and unified user experience, have a "
"large user base and eco system, and there's a lot of tools that improve the "

"Many developers have found that they can deploy their apps to most operating "
"systems with viable efforts. They can say, \"I make binaries for Windows\", "
"or \"I make binaries for macOS\". However, when trying to do the same for "
"Linux, they commonly face a situation where they cannot \"make binaries for "
"Linux\", but they have to make them for Ubuntu, Debian, CentOS, openSUSE "
"etc. Read: they have to make binaries for every distribution."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../source/introduction/motivation.rst:39
msgid ""
"The problem with this is that Linux is just the kernel, but the operating "
"systems users run are separate projects with separate goals and concerns. "
"They all ship with different versions and combinations of certain libraries, "
"and most of them require software to be shipped separately, linking to "
"binaries in the distribution. Therefore, in order to be able to run a "
"certain binary, that binary must be compiled *against* the distribution's "
"set of libraries. As soon as another distribution's collection of libraries "
"is not the same as the one the binary was built on, it will crash or even "
"refuse to run."

msgid ""
"To fix this issue, one has to do the same one would do to prevent issues "
"like missing shared libraries (or version incompatibilities) that is used on "
"other platforms: ship the dependency libraries along with the own software's "
"binaries."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../source/introduction/motivation.rst:43
msgid ""
"This can be accomplished using traditional tarballs that contain all the "
"libraries and maybe some sort of \"run script\" that makes sure only those "
"libraries are run, but it has a few major disadvantages. First of all, it is "
"hard to get the right set of libraries that must be shipped, excluding the "
"ones that would cause issues (lowest level dependencies such as ``libc``, "
"``libdl``, etc.). But even worse, the user is presented with an archive that "
"they must extract, and they must be explained how to actually run the "
"software within it. Furthermore, they now have that data on their hard "
"drive, and have to manage it themselves, without any kind of helpers."

"In order to improve the usability and reduce the maintenance effort, "
"AppImage was created. AppImages are bundles of programs, their dependency "
"libraries and all the resources they need during the runtime. They're single "
"binaries, following the \":ref:`one app = one file <one-app-one-file-"
"principle>`\" core principle."

"Making AppImages is very simple for a developer. There's tools which "
"generate an AppImage from a so-called :ref:`AppDir <ref-appdir>`. There's "
"simple tools to create such an AppDir for an existing software, which are "
"aware of potential cross distro incompatibilities, and try to avoid them. "
"And once the AppImage has been built, it will \"just run\" on all major "
"desktop distributions."
